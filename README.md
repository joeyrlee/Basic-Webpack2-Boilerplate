# Webpack2-ES6-Boilerplate

A Webpack 2 boilerplate with functional ES6 minification (thanks to fulls1z3's UglifyJs2#harmony webpack branch), tree-shaking, hot module replacement, and vanilla css loaders.

Successful `yarn (or npm) run build` development build followed by a production build (notice the size differences):
